  * [**Grover's algorithm code**](https://github.com/Qubitsey/QuantumAlgorithms/blob/main/Grover.ipynb)

    This tutorial provides a step-by-step walkthrough explaining Grover's quantum algorithm. We show how to build the corresponding quantum circuit with simple modular building blocks, by means of the Amazon Braket SDK.
