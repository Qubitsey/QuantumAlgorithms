  * [**Grover's algorithm code**](https://github.com/Qubitsey/QuantumAlgorithms/blob/main/Grover.ipynb)

    This tutorial provides a step-by-step walkthrough explaining Grover's quantum algorithm. We show how to build the corresponding quantum circuit with simple modular building blocks, by means of the Amazon Braket SDK. Specifically, we demonstrate how to build custom gates that are not part of the basic gate set provided by the SDK. A custom gate can used as a core quantum gate by registering it as a subroutine.
